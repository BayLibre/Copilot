Creating your own jack cable
----------------------------

Given the differences between barrel jack connectors (both the inside and
outside diameter) and the difficulty distinguishing between them, it may
make more sense to create a custom cable.

For example, a cable can be created using two barrel jack male connectors with
screw terminals. It is possible for some 2.1x5.5mm barrel jack connectors to also
work with 2.5x5.5mm female connectors.

The recommended diameter of the wire connecting the two adapters is 2.5mm² or
14 AWG, so that they will be able to carry the power with a minimized
resistance. You are of course free to use whatever cable you want that suits
your needs according to the load you are powering.

It is also recommended to keep the cable length as short as possible for the
designated task to minimize its resistance.

The connector ``CLEVER LITTLE BOX CLB-JL-52Y`` has been tested and holds up to
250W without issue or too much overheating.
