Tips and tricks

Creating your own jack cable
----------------------------

- You can use 2.1x5.5mm barrel jack male connectors with screw terminals and 2.5x5.5mm compatibility to create the needed jack-to-jack cables.
- The connector ``CLEVER LITTLE BOX CLB-JL-52Y`` has been tested fine, it holds up to 250W without issue or too much overheating.
- The recommended wires section to create the cable are 2.5mm2, so they will be able to carry the power with a minimized resistance.
  You are of course free to use whatever cable you want that suits your needs according to the load you are powering.
- It is recommended to keep the cable length as short as possible for the designated task to minimize its resistance.
